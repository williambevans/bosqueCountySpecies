         then JavaScript until I know I know what I think I know, 
         then Git until I know I know what I think I know
         then I'll React until I know I know what I think I know, 
         then Node until I know I know what I think I know, 
         then Mongo until I know I know what I think I know,
    Then, and finally then...Ill know I didn't know what I thought I knew.
